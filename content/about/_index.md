Hi, I'm Angel Dhakal, a passionate backend developer with a keen interest in creating efficient and scalable solutions. With several years of experience in the industry, I've worked on a variety of projects that have honed my skills in backend technologies.

## My Journey

I started my coding journey when I was in college, fascinated by how a few lines of code could create powerful applications. Since then, I've been on a continuous learning path, always excited to explore new technologies and methodologies.

## What I Do

As a backend developer, I specialize in:

- Designing and implementing robust APIs
- Database optimization and management
- Server-side application logic
- Microservices architecture
- DevOps and deployment strategies

I'm particularly passionate about creating clean, maintainable code and optimizing performance to deliver the best possible user experience.

## Beyond Coding

When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, reading tech blogs, or contributing to open-source projects. I believe in the power of community and knowledge sharing, which is why I actively participate in local tech meetups and online developer forums.

Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss a project, talk tech, or just say hello!
